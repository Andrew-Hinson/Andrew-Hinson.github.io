11-27-20 After looking at a bunch of the other submissions in the Odin project, a lot of people are using these huge run on If/Else statements incorporating && || as well. To me, it didn't read very well and looked really long and tedious. So I set out to try to find a way around that logic and simplify as best I could. I am open to any and all improvements to the core logic. As the saying goes "You don't know what you don't know!" Styling is not amazing but I admit I'm weak in that regard.
